# deep_learning_basic

very basic deep neural network step by step processes by hand with random points data.

First, using the traditional linear model to detect the taget area.

Then, build neural network with linear function, activation function and softmax function to do the classification. 

Important, I did not use any python deep learning package, and wrote the forward propagation and back propagation step by step.

Takeaways: adding regualrization for overfitting issue, fine-tuning hyperparameters and learning rate to get a better results.
