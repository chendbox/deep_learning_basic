# Neural_network_example.ipynb
very basic deep neural network step by step processes by hand with random points data.

First, using the traditional linear model to detect the taget area.

Then, build neural network with linear function, activation function and softmax function to do the classification. 

Important, I did not use any python deep learning package, and wrote the forward propagation and back propagation step by step.

Takeaways: adding regualrization for overfitting issue, fine-tuning hyperparameters and learning rate to get a better results. 

# mnist_cnn.py
I built convolutional neural netowrk to classify mnist data. x_train shape: (60000, 28, 28, 1), 60000 train samples, 10000 test samples
